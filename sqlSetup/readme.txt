
File Descriptions
1. create.sql: This script creates the database leidson_1 with tables Senator, Leadership, Committee, Subcommittee, Is_Member, and User. It also specifies primary keys, constraints, etc. for the database.

2. load.sql: After the creation of leidson_1 database using 'source create.sql', load.sql loads all of the data into the database.

Important Considerations
- The `load.sql` script presupposes the existence of the database and tables as established by `create.sql`.
